# Bond-Identifier
My project applies infrared spectroscopy concepts to a program that identifies bond peaks from IR charts. It takes 3 visible identifier inputs: i) peak shape (narrow/broad) ii) peak strength (strong/medium/weak) iii) approximate bond frequency wavelength. Based on these inputs, it outputs the bond structure represented by the peak.
